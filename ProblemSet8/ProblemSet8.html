  <h3><p>I had to go visit <i>Philadelphia</i> and the decision was made monday night.<br>
      Since it was the Midterm week and I had to go down on Wednesday night,<br>
      I had to do all my other homeworks before going down.<br>
      I really wanted to finish doing cv for this <b>ProblemSet8</b> <br>
      However, with a 7 hour bus ride and events in <i>Philadelphia</i>, <br>
      I couldn't find time to finish it. So I am doing a short version for <b>ProblemSet8</b> <br>
  </p></h3>

  <!-- I guess <p> is not needed if i manually do <br> but as a pracitce, i just used it in the code. -->
